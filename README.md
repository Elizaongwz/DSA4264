# Project 1


## Setting up the repository

You should set up your own virtual environment on your laptop to run all the notebooks in this repository. You may do this in your preferred way, but a simple way to set this up would be:

1. Run `python -m venv venv` to create your virtual environment (note that I am using Python 3.11.5)
2. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the full list of requirements
